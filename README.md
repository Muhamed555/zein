  <p> A python library for ensuring the safety and security of ML models and their outputs for the Arabic and Islamic community.</p>

### Library Mission
- The package includes a module that filters out profane words in Arabic text, using a comprehensive list of swear words and a smart algorithm that can handle variations and misspellings.
- The package also includes a module that detects offensive sentences that insult or mock any of the Abrahamic religions (Islam, Christianity, Judaism), or any person or institution associated with them. The module uses natural language processing and sentiment analysis to identify the tone and intention of the sentences.
- The package further includes a module that detects sexual images, or images that disrespect or ridicule any of the prophets or sacred symbols of the Abrahamic religions. The module uses computer vision and deep learning to classify and flag the images.
